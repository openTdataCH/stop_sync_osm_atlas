Key findings
GTFS
SLOIDs with GTFS routes: 34,766
Avg unique routes per sloid: 2.73 (median 2.00)
Avg unique (route,direction) per sloid: 4.39 (median 3.00)
Duplicate groups for (sloid, route_norm, direction): 96.97%
Many groups exhibit multiple distinct direction strings even for same route+dir (from first→last heuristics).
HRDF
SLOIDs with HRDF lines: 28,757
Avg unique lines per sloid: 2.32 (median 2.00)
Avg distinct directions per (sloid,line_name): 2.67 (by UIC and by name)
Some (sloid,line_name) pairs show 30–40 distinct first→last UIC pairs, reflecting diverse trip patterns.
